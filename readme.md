# Todo App - MERN Stack

## About the Project
This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) Todo application built using Create React App. It allows users to create, manage, and delete tasks in a todo list.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Open the project directory in your terminal.
2. Run `npm start` to start the app in development mode.
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run several scripts:

### Frontend

- `npm start`: Starts the app in development mode.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm run eject`: Removes the single build dependency and copies all configuration files and dependencies into the project.

### Backend

- `npm start`: Starts the backend server.
- `npm run test`: Runs the backend tests.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started), the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/), and the [MERN Stack documentation](https://mern.io/).

## Project Structure
The project is structured into two main sections: 'backend' and 'frontend'. The backend is responsible for server-side operations, while the frontend is for client-side interactions.

### Backend

- `package-lock.json` and `package.json`: These files manage dependencies and configurations for the backend.
- `server.js`: The main entry point for the backend server.
- `Controllers`: Directory containing JavaScript files that handle requests and responses.
- `Middleware`: Directory containing JavaScript files that handle request processing.
- `Models`: Directory containing JavaScript files that define the structure and behavior of data.
- `Routes`: Directory containing JavaScript files that define the URLs and their corresponding handlers.

### Frontend

- `package-lock.json` and `package.json`: Similar to the backend, these files manage dependencies and configurations for the frontend.
- `tailwind.config.js`: Configures the Tailwind CSS framework for styling.
- `public`: A static directory containing essential assets like favicon, index.html, and manifest.json.
- `src`: The main directory for frontend source code, containing JavaScript and CSS files.

## Notable Aspects

- The use of Tailwind CSS for styling the frontend, which is a utility-first CSS framework.
- The separation of backend and frontend, which is a common practice in MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack applications.
- The use of controllers, middleware, models, and routes directories for organizing backend code, which is a common practice in Express.js applications.
- The use of a README.md file in both the backend and frontend directories, which is a good practice for documenting the project.

In summary, the project is a MERN stack application with a well-structured backend and frontend, following best practices for organizing code and using popular technologies like Tailwind CSS and Express.js.
